<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marisol Jim√©nez, I'm a 21 year old preschool teacher. I was studying Business Administration but I didn't like it and I dropped out after 1 semester. </p>

<p>I took 2 gap years before I saw a job posting about an assistant teacher and I applied even though I didn't have a degree and I got accepted. I was an assistant teacher for a year, then I was a receptionist at a dental clinic for 3 months before I got a call from m old job asking if I could cover for an assistant teacher for a month so I immediately agreed and as my month was almost up, the art and cooking teacher quit so they offered me the position and I took it.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying Sistemas Computacionales online, this way I'm able to balance both my job and my studies.
These are some of my interests:
 <ul>
  <li>Language learning</li>
  <li>Dancing</li>
  <li>Singing</li>
  <li>Mixed media</li>
  <li>Ocasionally playing the piano</li>
 </ul>
